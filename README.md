**A Digital Approach to Hypertension Control: Self-Monitoring with Mhealth Apps     Apr, 2024 -Jun, 2024**

**Sacred Heart University, Department of Healthcare Informatics**

A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed English articles from 2019-2024 in CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases using specific keywords related to AI and caries detection was conducted. 
Out of 30 initial studies, 25 were selected based on relevance to caries detection in permanent teeth and completeness of data.
Conducted a review of the selected studies, organizing findings by four major themes: AI model precision, various AI models, image processing methods, and cost-benefit analysis.
The findings are AI models, particularly deep learning with convolutional neural networks, showed 70-98% accuracy in caries detection, generally outperforming dentists.

**The Dental Detectives, AI evolving Role in early caries detection 	Jan, 2024 -Jun, 2024**

**Sacred Heart University, Department of Healthcare Informatics**

Conducted a review of peer-reviewed English articles from 2018-2024 in PubMed, CINAHL, and Medline databases using keywords related to hypertension and mHealth apps.
Included studies on hypertension management using mHealth apps, focusing on patient engagement and cost-effectiveness; excluded studies on other diseases, non-English publications, and wearable devices without apps.
Initially identified 523 articles, screened titles to 122, then selected 25 relevant articles based on abstracts and full texts.
Systematically reviewed and summarized key findings to identify patterns, themes, and gaps in the literature related to mHealth apps' influence on hypertension management.

**Data Analysis Projects**

**Visualizing the Opioid Death Toll: Connecticut's Story**       

For my project titled Visualizing the Opioid Toll: Connecticut's Story, I gathered data from Kaggle and used Excel for data cleaning, in data cleaning removed duplicates and missing data was filtered out and analysis of the data only for CT was considered. Employed the use of statistical functions, IF and Else logics and pivot tables to derive key statistics such as and mean, mode standard deviation, quartiles, and frequency of age groups to visualize the standard deviation. Used various other excel functions for analysing the distribution and cause of deaths relating to the medication/ prescription abuse, substance abuse or overdose or alcohol related drug deaths. Analysis was also done to identify the frequency of the age group addicted and distribution of race in different counties and also city level break-down. With the visualizations and use of various charts a pie chart for percentage of death by race, a bar graph for percentage of gender distribution for the type of abuse. A standard deviation curve that gives the most affected age range and have deaths. A butterfly chart for count of male vs females in various age groups distribution. A funnel chart gives a count of death with different substances.
