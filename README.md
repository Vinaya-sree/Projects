**Sacred Heart University, Department of Healthcare Informatics**

A comprehensive review of peer-reviewed English articles from 2019-2024 in CINAHL, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases using specific keywords related to AI and caries detection was conducted. 
Out of 30 initial studies, 25 were selected based on relevance to caries detection in permanent teeth and completeness of data.
Conducted a review of the selected studies, organizing findings by four major themes: AI model precision, various AI models, image processing methods, and cost-benefit analysis.
The findings are AI models, particularly deep learning with convolutional neural networks, showed 70-98% accuracy in caries detection, generally outperforming dentists.

**The Dental Detectives, AI evolving Role in early caries detection 	Jan, 2024 -Jun, 2024**

**Sacred Heart University, Department of Healthcare Informatics**

Conducted a review of peer-reviewed English articles from 2018-2024 in PubMed, CINAHL, and Medline databases using keywords related to hypertension and mHealth apps.
Included studies on hypertension management using mHealth apps, focusing on patient engagement and cost-effectiveness; excluded studies on other diseases, non-English publications, and wearable devices without apps.
Initially identified 523 articles, screened titles to 122, then selected 25 relevant articles based on abstracts and full texts.
Systematically reviewed and summarized key findings to identify patterns, themes, and gaps in the literature related to mHealth apps' influence on hypertension management.
